*Open with gitpod by clicking the button above.
Then run ```dotnet run``` in the terminal to see the output.*

You can play around with the code inside gitpod and see the output each time with ```dotnet run```.


## About
This is an initial play around with using [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) to create a fluent interface for detecting anomalies in data.

At present it uses statically typed objects to run but ideally (if I get time to add to this) you would also be able to pass in dynamically read-in data from CSVs/SQL etc. as well.
